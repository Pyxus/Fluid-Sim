## About

This project was originally conceived as a fluid simulator for my computer graphics class.
However, the result I got was a lot closer to a sand simulation.

## Launching

1. Download the Windows.zip from the v1.0 release.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file
3. Run FluidSimWindows.exe

## Usage

- `Left click` to draw cell
- `Right click` to erase cell
- `Up/Down` arrow keys to adjust placement amount
- `Spacebar` to switch between sand mode and solid mode
